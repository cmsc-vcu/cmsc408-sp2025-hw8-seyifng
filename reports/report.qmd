In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table? 265

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns

## (skills: select, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
where
  `Currency Unit` IS NULL
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
""")
```

```{python}
# create table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
CREATE TABLE wdi_country AS

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select count(*) as "Countries (Filtered)"
from wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select distinct Region
from wdi_country
order by Region
""")

```

## Task 7

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

  and `WB-2 code` is not null
  and `2-alpha code` != `WB-2 code`
order by
  `Short Name`

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.
## List the income categories and the number of countries in each
## income category in descending order of most countries to least.

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

I feel most confident in using basic SQL operations such as SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.However, I think I need more practice with advanced SQL concepts like CTEs, window functions, and using CASE statements effectively. Tasks like 18 and 19, which required combining multiple concepts, were challenging but rewarding. This assignment helped me reinforce my understanding of SQL and improved my ability to write complex queries and debug issues when the results were not as expected.


2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For complex tasks, I started by carefully reading the problem statement and identifying the key requirements. I broke the problem into smaller, manageable steps and wrote intermediate queries to validate my understanding of the data. For example, in Task 18, I first created a list of all possible combinations of regions and income groups before filtering out the missing ones.
When I encountered challenges, I referred to SQL documentation and online resources to understand the syntax and logic better. In the future, I would document my thought process to make debugging easier.


3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The biggest takeaway is the importance of understanding the data and the problem before jumping into writing queries. This assignment also highlighted the value of writing clean, modular queries and using advanced SQL features like CTEs and window functions to simplify complex problems. These skills are highly applicable in real-world scenarios, such as analyzing large datasets, generating reports, and transforming data for machine learning models. They will also be valuable in future coursework that involves data manipulation and analysis.
